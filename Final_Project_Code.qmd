### Data Descriptions

In this analysis, we use data collected by Gallup World Poll on November 20, 2024 which contains the national average response to the question of life evaluations. We additionally include information from a dataset provided by Gapminder on the mean daily household per capita income. Our analysis includes the years 2005 - 2023. We omitted any countrys and years who had missing values for either the happiness score or their mean daily household per capita income.

### Hypothesis

We believe that as daily income increases, so does the happiness score (WHR). Typically higher incomes means more financial freedom, this lowers the stress that is built up from worrying about financial problems like cost of living. In the article, “Does more money correlate with greater happiness?” by Michele W. Berger, Matthew Killingsworth argues that “for most people larger incomes are associated with greater happiness” (Berger 2023).


```{r}
data1 <- read_csv("hapiscore_whr.csv", show_col_types = F)
data2 <- read_csv("mincpcap_cppp.csv", show_col_types = F)



clean_data1 <- data1 %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = `2005`:`2023`,
              names_to = "year",
              values_to = "happiness")
  


clean_data2 <- data2 %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = `1800`:`2100`,
              names_to = 'year',
              values_to = "daily_income")
  
  
data <- clean_data1 %>% 
  inner_join(clean_data2, 
             by = join_by(country == country, year == year)) %>% 
  na.omit()

kable(data, col.names = c("Country", "Year", "Happiness"," Daily Income"), align = "c", digits = 2)
```

### Written Components:

Present and discuss visualizations of the relationship between the variables.

Describe the statistical method used – linear regression.

Present the estimated regression model (in notation).

Interpret the linear regression coefficients (in context).

Describe the fit of the regression model (both in table and written format).

### Data Visualization
Create two visualizations exploring the following:

The relationship between the two quantitative variables you are investigating.
Remember: your response variable should be on the y-axis and your explanatory variable should be on the x-axis.
You may want to aggregate the values for each country over all years in the data (so each point is one country)
```{r}
grouped_data <- data %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(happiness = mean(happiness), 
            daily_income = mean(daily_income))


ggplot(data = grouped_data, mapping = aes(x = log(daily_income), y = happiness))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(colour = "blue", method = lm)+
  labs(x = "Daily Income (log(Mean over the years))", 
       y = "Happiness Score (Mean over the years)", 
       title = "Scatterplot of Happiness compared to Daily Income")

```


How this relationship (from #1) has changed over time using an animated plot. 
The gganimate package makes it easy to animate ggplot2 graphics.

```{r}
animated_plot <- ggplot(data = data, mapping = aes(x = log(daily_income), y = happiness)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue", alpha = 0.5) +
  transition_states(
    year,
    transition_length = 2,
    state_length = 1
  ) +
  enter_fade() + 
  exit_shrink() +
  ease_aes('sine-in-out') +
  labs(
    x = "log(Daily Income)", 
    y = "Happiness Score", 
    title = "Happiness vs Daily Income by Country",
    subtitle = "Year: {closest_state}") +
  theme_minimal()

### Linear Regression
Fit a simple linear regression model for the relationship between the variables you selected.

To perform your linear regression, you will likely want to summarize your data so you have one x value and one y value per country. You may do this by averaging (or taking the median) across all years, averaging across a subset of years, or picking a year of particular interest. Make sure you discuss your decision in your written report.

If you did not do this for your first visualization in 2.1, please include a scatterplot of the data that you will use in your regression model. You should be able to plot the exact regression line that you fit on this plot. This plot may also reveal that you need to transform the x or the y variable so that they show a linear relationship.

```{r}
model <- lm(happiness ~ log(daily_income), data = grouped_data)
```


Report the coefficients of your fitted model, either in text, or using a nicely formatted table.

You may want to use LaTeX to nicely format your regression model if you report it in text.
LaTeX allows us to easily typeset complicated mathematical formulas. You can include LaTeX math within a Quarto document with $’s.
E.g., basic infoLinks to an external site. on adding equations to a Quarto doc.


```{r}
tidy(model)
```

### Model Fit

The goal of regression is to account for as much variability in the response values as we can. To assess how “good” of a regression model you have, look at how much of the variability in the response was accounted for by your regression.

The variance in your fitted values represents the amount of variability in the response that was accounted for by the explanatory variable. The variance in the residuals represents the amount of variability in the responses that was not accounted for.

Make a nicely formatted table that presents the following:

The variance in the response values. (A)
The variance in the fitted values from your regression model. (B)
The variance in the residuals from your regression model.
The model R2 (B / A)
You should format your table nicely using either the kable and kableExtra or gt

kableLinks to an external site. – nice, basic HTML tables with the kable() function.

The kableExtra packageLinks to an external site. – additional styling features of your HTML table.

The gtLinks to an external site. package - create more sophisticated, report-ready tables.

```{r}
glance(model) %>%  
  kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_classic()
```


Discuss the proportion of the variability in the response values that was accounted for by your regression model. What does this suggest about the “quality” of your model?

The proportion of variability for Happiness Score explained by the log of daily income is .7228, which means that 72.28% of a variablility in Happiness Score can be explained by the log of daily income. This suggests that the quality of our model is good.
